We use the <a href="https://lawrencez22.github.io/projects/4_project/">Head-mounted Sensor Platform</a> to construct the first dataset comprising egocentric hand actions captured through RGB-D, IR, and thermal cameras. The 2.5D hand pose is semi-automatically annotated using <a href="https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose">OpenPose</a> on RGB-D images and is further optimized before being projected onto the thermal image frame. More details will be included in our ECCV24 submission.
