I am a thesis-track MSCS student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, supervised by [Dr. Danfei Xu](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~danfei/), researching mobile and dexterous egocentric imitation learning. My research interests include egocentric computer vision, fine-grained 3D spatial interfaces, and imitation learning.

Before joining Georgia Tech, I graduated with first-class honours in BSc Computer Science from the University of Edinburgh. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research on a transformer-based egocentric thermal hand pose estimator and constructed the first multispectral, multiview hand action dataset at [MAPS Lab](https://maps-lab.github.io/), under the supervision of [Prof. Chris Lu](https://christopherlu.github.io/).
